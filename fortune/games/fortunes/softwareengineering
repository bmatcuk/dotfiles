... the designer of a new system must not only be the implementor
and the first large-scale user; the designer should also write the

activities, literally hundreds of improvements would never have
been made, because I would never have thought of them or perceived
why they were important.

Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice

theory and practice: Nothing works and they don't know why.

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way
is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies,
and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no
obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.

Brian Russell's Laws
of Software Relativity (cf. Belady and Lehman's Laws of Software
Evolution)
  * As a software project approaches release, its mass increases.
  *The energy required to release a software project is inversely
  proportional to the time before a scheduled release.  *It takes
  infinite energy to release a finished product on time; therefore,
  all software projects are both incomplete and late.  *Time is
  relative to the observer of a software project. The last month of
  development appears to an outside observer to take a year.  *If a
  software project becomes too large, it will collapse into a black
  hole.  Time and money are absorbed but nothing ever comes out.

The goal of product management is customer satisfaction. The
product management role is positioned to achieve this by acting
as the customer advocate to the team and as the team advocate to
the customer. It is important to distinguish between the customer
and the end user--the customer is the one who pays for the product
while the end user is the one who uses the product.

More than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one
of the best bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done
to create a useful test can discover and eliminate bugs before they
are coded - indeed, test-design thinking can discover and eliminate
bugs at every stage in the creation of software, from conception
to specification, to design, coding and the rest.
